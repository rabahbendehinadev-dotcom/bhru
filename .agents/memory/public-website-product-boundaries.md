name: Public website product boundaries
description: User-stated future URL, slug lifetime and shared-template requirements; implementation remains separately authorized.
---

The intended default public website URL is `https://bhru.net/{subscriber-slug}`, not a wildcard subdomain. Slugs are generated automatically from the business/server name when the subscriber is created; changing that business name later must not automatically change its slug.

**Why:** The user specified automatic URLs without a registration slug picker and stated that existing customer links must not break.

**How to apply:** Preserve this URL and lifetime model in future work. Normalization rules, reserved names, storage changes, public resolution and subscription-status behavior still require approval before implementation.

A future custom hostname is an additional mapping to the same subscriber business, website and business data. It must not create another subscriber, another website copy, another business database or duplicated CMS content.

**Why:** The user explicitly requires the default URL and a future custom domain to resolve to the same website and data.

**How to apply:** Reuse the existing ownership boundary recorded in Subscriber Settings staging; do not introduce another tenant/server/workspace identity for public routing.

BHRU will have one shared public website template. Subscribers will later customize its logo, index banner, page content, services, testimonials, gallery, blog, contact information and appearance through their panel/CMS.

**Why:** The user explicitly ruled out separate source-code copies per subscriber.

**How to apply:** Resolve slug/hostname to the owning subscriber and then scoped public CMS content for the shared template. The template, CMS and custom domains are future work, not authorized by an architecture-analysis request.
